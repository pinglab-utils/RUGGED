    "LITERATURE_RETRIEVAL_EXAMPLE": "The investigation of Atenolol (DB00335) as a potential therapeutic for Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) has been supported by a combination of literature evidence. Our system identified four research publications relevant to Atenolol and ACM, including two original research articles and two clinical case reports.\n\n**Original Research Articles**\n- **Effect of beta-blockers on arrhythmias during six weeks after suspected myocardial infarction (PMID: 387170)** This study examined the incidence of arrhythmias in patients with suspected myocardial infarction treated with either propranolol, atenolol, or placebo. The findings indicated that beta-blockers, including atenolol, did not show significant antiarrhythmic action in the dosage used. This study raises doubts about the effectiveness of atenolol in reducing arrhythmias post-myocardial infarction, which could imply limited utility in treating ACM-related arrhythmias.\n- **Comparison of the effects of xamoterol, atenolol, and propranolol on breathlessness, fatigue, and plasma electrolytes during exercise in healthy volunteers (PMID: 1685993)** This research investigated the effects of atenolol and other beta-blockers on heart rate, blood pressure, and electrolyte concentrations during exercise. Atenolol significantly reduced maximum exercise heart rate and blood pressure. The study suggests that atenolol’s impact on exercise-induced hyperkalaemia could be beneficial in managing exercise-induced arrhythmias, which is relevant for ACM.\n**Clinical Case Reports**\n- **Exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in a family (PMID: 9106603)** This case report describes a family with a history of sudden cardiac deaths and exercise-induced arrhythmias. The patients were treated with atenolol, which significantly reduced exertional arrhythmias as assessed by serial treadmill tests. This suggests atenolol may be effective in preventing exercise-induced arrhythmias, which is pertinent to ACM.\n- **Sertraline-induced rhabdomyolysis in an elderly patient with dementia and comorbidities (PMID: 19567656)** While this report primarily discusses sertraline-induced rhabdomyolysis, it mentions atenolol as part of the patient's medication regimen without adverse interactions. This is less directly relevant but indicates atenolol's general safety profile in complex patient cases.\n**Synthesis of Evidence**\nThe literature provides mixed support for the hypothesis that atenolol could be used to treat ACM. The original research articles offer limited evidence of atenolol’s effectiveness in reducing arrhythmias associated with myocardial infarction, but suggest potential benefits in managing exercise-induced arrhythmias. The clinical case reports, particularly the one involving a family with exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias, support atenolol’s efficacy in reducing such arrhythmias, relevant to ACM.\n\nBased on the majority of the evidence from original research and supported by clinical case reports, atenolol shows some promise in managing exercise-induced arrhythmias, which is pertinent for Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy. However, its overall effectiveness and utility specifically for ACM require further validation through clinical trials and wet lab experiments.",
